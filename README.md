# Valence_with_AI

The **aim** of this project is to understand how good is **AI** for **generating code**. Is it *useless*? Is it a *great tool* for programmers?
<br>Is it able to create code for people who *don't know how to code*? It is what we will see.

This project is based on the *Valence* project. Three students are trying to **reproduce some code** from this project, but using **three different AI**:
- Chat GPT
- Bard
- Auto-GPT

We are working on a **similar template** so you can easily **compare** the results between the different AI.
