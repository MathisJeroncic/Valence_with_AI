# Valence_with_AI

The **aim** of this project is to determine how good is **AI** for **generating code** and **understanding code**. Is it *useless*? Is it a *great tool* for programmers? Is it able to create and give descriptions of code for people who *don't know how to code*? It is what we will see.

This project is based on the [*Valence project*](https://github.com/VALENCEML/eBOOK) project. Three students are trying to **reproduce some code** from this project, also **create descriptions of codes** or **definitions**, but using **three different AI**:
- Chat GPT
- Bard
- Auto-GPT

We are working on a **similar template** so you can easily **compare** the results between the different AI.

3 differents notebook have been write: 
- From code to despcrition", we give a full code and ask for a description
- "From description to code", we give a description and ask for a code
- "Find errors warnings and optimization", we give a full code and ask for errors/warnings and an optimization of the code

All of our results are available in "Graph Valence"
